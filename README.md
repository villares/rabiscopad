## RabiscoPad

A bare-bones SVG sketchpad - Licensed under GPL v3.0

Developed by [Alexandre B A Villares](http://twitter.com/villares) and [Foad S. Farimani](https://twitter.com/fsfarimani)

### How to run this?

- You will need [to install Processing Python Mode](https://abav.lugaralgum.com/como-instalar-o-processing-modo-python/index-EN.html)â€” we might provide self-contained "builds" for Linux, MacOS & Windows one day (you could volunteer to mantain them!);
- Clone this repository or just hit [download](https://github.com/villares/rabiscopad/archive/main.zip);
- Use the Processing IDE to open the `rabiscopad.pyde` file, mind it must be kept on its folder named `rabiscopad` with its `.py` modules.

### How to contribute?

  [TODO: We need better instructions]
  - Start by opening a conversation in an issue, after some talk, we will probably love to have your PRs too!

## TODO IDEAS:

- [X] GUI buttons (can be improved a lot)
    - [X] stroke/pen colors
    - [ ] stroke weight
    - [X] drawing modes 
	
- [WIP] save SVG with timestamp on name
	- [X] saving SVG on sketch folder with timestamp name!
	- [ ] save SVG to user selected location

- [ ] load & save drawing
	- HARDER: load SVG and parse elements to allow editing saved file
	- EASIER: save/load session data in a serialized file
		REALLY EASY: pickle
		I'd have to look: JSON

- [ ] modes & elements
	- [X] line
	- [X] circle
	- [X] "quad"/rectangle
	- [ ] triangle / regular polygon ?
	- [ ] polygon
	- [X] select/edit mode
		- erase selected element
		- drag mouse to move them
		- transform (**with the scroll wheel!**)
		   - rotate
		   - scale

- [ ] snapping
	- to grid / ruler
	- to objects (possibly very hard)

- [ ] other features:
	- import image - maybe hard
	- export raster image (PNG) - easy peasy
	- import / open SVG (hard if you want to edit things, easy otherwise)
	- layers (maybe hard)
	- zoom and pan (maybe hard...)
	- change background
	- resize the window (maybe nasty)
	
- [WIP] two-key keyboard shortcuts 
	- [X] <kbd>cmd/ctrl + s</kbd> --> save
	- <kbd>cmd/ctrl + z</kbd> --> undo (maybe hard, but I had some ideas...)
	- <kbd>cmd/ctrl + r</kbd> --> redo (see above)
	- <kbd>cmd/ctrl + d</kbd> --> duplicate selected / last drawn
